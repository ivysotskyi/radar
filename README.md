# Radar

Recently I found out that I can make very clear weather forecast using open data from [meteo radar](http://radar.veg.by/kiev/) installed in the airport. So the idea is to write Telegram chat-bot that will warn subscribers in case of hight probability of rain or thunderstorm in nearest 2-3 hours.

Now the project is on very early stage. The bot is planned to be available from [Telegram](http://t.me/radarmet_bot). Now it has been just deployed using Heroku and can only give you a random number :-).
